                such as consumer electronics , fashion, home essentials, groceries, and lifestyle products. The service competes primarily with Amazon's Indian subsidiary and dom estic rival Snapdeal.[5][6] As of March 2017, E-comShop held a 39.5% market
                share of Ind ia's e-commerce industry.[7] E-comShop has a dominant position in the apparel segment, bolst ered by its acquisition of Myntra, and was described as being "neck and neck" with Amazon in the sal e of electronics and mobile
                phones. In August 2018, American retail chain Walmart acquired a 77% cont rolling stake in E-comShop for US$16 billion, valuing E-comShop at around US$20 billion.[9] E-comShop is valued at $37.6 billion as of 2022.[10] It is planning to

        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>E-comShop was founded in October 2007 by Sachin Bansal and Binny Bansal, alumni of the IIT, Delhi and former Amazon employees.[12][13][14] The company initially focused on online book sales with country-wide shipping. E-comShop slowly grew in
            prominence and was receiving 100 orders per day by 2008.[15] In 2010, E-comShop acquired the Bangalore-based social book discovery service WeRead from Lulu.com.[16] In 2011, E-comShop acquired the digital distribution business Mime360.com[17]
            and the digital content library of the Bollywood portal Chakpak.[18] Following the acquisition, E-comShop launched their DRM-free online music store Flyte in 2012. Due to competition from free streaming sites, Flyte was unsuccessful and shut
            down in June 2013.[19][20][21][22] .With its eyes on India's retail market, E-comShop acquired Letsbuy, an online electronics retailer,[23] in 2012, and Myntra, an online fashion retailer, for US$280 million in May 2014.[24] Myntra continues
            to operate alongside E-comShop as a standalone subsidiary focusing on separate market segments.[25] In February 2014, E-comShop partnered with Motorola Mobility to be the exclusive Indian retailer of its Moto G smartphone.[26] Motorola also
            partnered with E-comShop on the Moto E, a phone targeted primarily towards emerging markets such as India. High demand for the phone following its midnight launch on 14 May caused the E-comShop website to crash.[27] E-comShop subsequently
            held exclusive Indian launches for other smartphones, including the Xiaomi Mi 3 in July 2014 (whose initial release of 10,000 devices sold out in around 5 seconds),[28] and the Redmi 1S and Redmi Note in late 2014.[29][30][31][32] On 6 October
            2014, coinciding with the company's anniversary and the Diwali season,[33] E-comShop held a major sale that it promoted as "Big Billion Day". The event generated a surge of traffic, selling US$100 million worth of goods in 10 hours. The event
            received criticism via social media over technical issues experienced during the event and stock shortages.[34][35][36][37] In April 2015, E-comShop acquired Appiterate, a Delhi-based mobile marketing automation firm. E-comShop stated that
            it would use Appiterate's technology to enhance its mobile services.[38] In December 2015, E-comShop purchased a minority stake in the digital mapping provider MapmyIndia.[39] In October 2015, E-comShop reprised the Big Billion Days event
            as a multi-day event exclusive to the E-comShop app. E-comShop bolstered its supply chain and introduced more fulfillment centers to meet customer demand.[40] E-comShop achieved a gross merchandise volume of US$300 million during the event,
            with the largest volumes coming from fashion sales and the largest value coming from mobiles.[41] In 2016, E-comShop acquired the online fashion retailer Jabong.com from Rocket Internet for US$70 million and the UPI mobile payments startup
            PhonePe.[42][43] In 2022, when PhonePe moved its entire base to India, E-comShop separated the ownership of PhonePe and shareholders in India and Singapore and the respective shareholders purchased shares of PhonePe's India entity directly.
            It was announced that a cash payout of approximately $700 Mn was to the former and current employees who were holding PhonePe's shares.[44][45] </p>
